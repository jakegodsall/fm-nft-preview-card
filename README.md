## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

The most difficult aspect of this challenge was layering over the overlay on the main image. I achieved this by using the `::after` pseudo-element on the parent container of the image. This is the first time I have used pseudo-elements.

### Continued development

I intend to improve the responsivity of this component so that is scales and is positioned correctly as the viewport changes.
